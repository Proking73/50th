            <p>First of all, all throughout my life, you have been supportive of me. When I cry, you console me. When I need help, you either say to ask Mama or (very rarely) actually help me yourself. When I have a project due the next day, you help record it and give suggestions. And most importantly, you give me fun. From Canada to India, all around the world, you make sure that every moment is as joyful as possible with visiting Uncles and Aunties, eating Taco bell, and much more. I wish you a happy 50th birthday, and for more fun experiences throughout your golden years. (but don't forget that you're still old)</p>
